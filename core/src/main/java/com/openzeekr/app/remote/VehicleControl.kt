/**
 * BLE-first, cloud-fallback command dispatcher.
 *
 * Actions the DK session can actuate directly (a one-byte control inside a 0x0110 frame — see
 * [DkProtocol]'s CTRL_* table) are tried over BLE **when the key session is live**, reading the car's
 * confirmation; on any BLE failure/reject, or when there's no live session, or when the action has no
 * BLE equivalent, we fall back to the cloud ([RemoteControlRepository.send]).
 *
 * Only actions the app actually exposes are mapped to a BLE byte. Engine/remote-start (0x08), panic
 * (0x05) and key-inside/outside (0x09/0x0B) are intentionally left cloud/none. These BLE bytes are from
 * reverse-engineering and not all verified at the car yet — hence the cloud fallback on failure.
