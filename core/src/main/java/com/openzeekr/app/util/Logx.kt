/**
 * App-wide logging with two INDEPENDENT category gates, both driven by Settings switches:
 *  - **HTTP logging** ([setHttp]) gates the cloud request/response traces (areas in [HTTP_TAGS]:
 *    http, login, net, session, tsp, push) - tokens, VIN, request/response bodies.
 *  - **BLE logging** ([setBle]) gates the digital-key / proximity traffic (areas in [BLE_TAGS]:
 *    ble, carprox, dk, lock, motion, provision, prox, svc) - key material, RSSI, handshakes.
 * Each can be turned on/off separately so a tester can watch one category without the other's
 * spam. A verbose [d] call is emitted only while its own category is ON; with a category OFF it
 * is fully suppressed (not even logcat), so an idle app never sprays that category's secrets.
 *
 * Two tiers within each category:
 *  - **verbose (D)** - fully gated on the matching category flag (see above).
 *  - **warnings/errors (W/E)** - low-volume, non-bulk (no HTTP bodies; secrets already go
 *    through [preview]). Always emitted to logcat so real failures are still diagnosable, but
 *    only added to the on-device buffer while EITHER category is ON.
 *
 * The ring buffer is a [StateFlow] the UI shows on-device (handy at the car with no debugger).
 * It is cleared when BOTH categories go off. Nothing is persisted, so a restart clears it too.
 *
 * Secrets: helper [preview] keeps sensitive values out of the log while still showing enough
 * to debug (length + last 4 chars).
