/**
 * Approach-unlock / walk-away-lock driven by BLE RSSI, with distance + trend hysteresis.
 *
 * Rides the live keep-alive session (see [ProximityService]); it reads the connected-GATT RSSI
 * and never owns the connection. Connected RSSI is the accurate near-field ranging source.
 *
 * Decision model (the tuning the user asked for):
 *  - **Latch**: once we auto-unlock we set [armedUnlocked] and won't unlock again until a lock
 *    happens — so no repeated unlock spam while you stand at the car.
 *  - **Approach**: unlock only with evidence you walked up — the phone moved recently, or (no motion
 *    sensor) a FAR→NEAR crossing was observed ([ApproachMotionGate]). A phone at rest next to the car
 *    (e.g. the service restarted overnight with the car in the garage) does nothing.
 *  - **Hysteresis**: unlock at/above [ConfigStore.sensitivityUnlockRssi] (≈ near), lock at/below
 *    [ConfigStore.sensitivityLockRssi] (≈ farther). The gap between them stops flapping.
 *  - **Cooldown**: after any action, ignore new triggers for [ACTION_COOLDOWN_MS].
 *  - **Adaptive cadence**: 200 ms burst polling while near a threshold or moving (cheap over an
 *    already-open link), 2 s when solidly far/near and steady (low power).
 *
 * On link loss we distinguish an ACCIDENTAL drop (last sample near / not receding → keep armed,
 * let the keep-alive reconnect, don't lock) from a WALK-AWAY (last sample receding or already far
 * → lock after [LINK_LOSS_LOCK_DELAY_MS] if it doesn't come back).
 *
 * The RSSI→metre estimate is for display/logging only (log-distance path loss with a nominal
 * [TX_POWER_1M]/[PATH_LOSS_N] — calibrate at the car). Decisions use RSSI thresholds directly,
 * which are what the single sensitivity knob tunes.
