/**
 * Foreground service that keeps the digital key live once the phone is provisioned:
 *
 *  1. **Keep-alive** — holds the DK BLE session connected to the car (reconnecting
 *     whenever it drops) so manual and approach lock/unlock are instant.
 *  2. **Approach** — when the "lock/unlock on approach" setting is on, runs the
 *     RSSI proximity controller (approach-unlock / walk-away-lock).
 *
 * Started by the app once logged in + provisioned (see AppBootstrap); pair with a
 * battery-optimization exemption for reliability. Runs as a connectedDevice FGS.
